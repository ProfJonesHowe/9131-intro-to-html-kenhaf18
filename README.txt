	<h1>Why I like fitness<h1>
		<h2>Hyprid training has hooked me<h2>
			<p>Hybrid training brings a fun aspect and balance into fitness. "Look good feel good" is often said in this type of training. Pushing weights to build muscle and running to feel good. It's alot to do at once and an easy way to burn out. Hybrid training is not for everyone but for a particualr group of people who want to perform their best everywhere.<p>
